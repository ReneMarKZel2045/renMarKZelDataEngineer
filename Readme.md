### **Introduction**

Bellabeat, a company that sells smart health trackers, has collected a range of data through its devices. The goal of this project is to analyze this data and help Bellabeat improve their marketing strategies by identifying key trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

### **Project Goals**

The main goals of this capstone project are:
- Analyze user activity data to gain insights on behavior.
- Identify correlations between different variables such as steps, sleep patterns, and calories burned.
- Provide recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy based on findings.

### **Data Collection**

The data used in this project comes from Bellabeat's smart devices and includes the following datasets:
- **User Activity Data:** Steps, active minutes, calories burned, etc.
- **Sleep Data:** Duration, quality, and times of sleep.
- **Heart Rate Data:** Heart rate monitoring during activities and sleep.
- **Hydration and Weight Data:** Data on user hydration levels and weight.

### **Data Cleaning**

This section details the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data, including:
- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Correcting data types.
- Standardizing date and time formats.
- Filtering outliers and anomalies.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This section presents the visualizations and statistics used to understand trends in the data:
- **User activity patterns:** A look at how users’ daily activities and steps vary.
- **Sleep quality analysis:** Insights into how sleep duration and quality affect user health.
- **Correlation analysis:** Identifying key relationships between variables such as steps, heart rate, and calories.

### **Insights and Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following insights are provided:
1. **User Activity:** Identifying peak activity times during the day.
2. **Sleep:** Understanding how users’ sleep affects overall activity and health.
3. **Marketing Recommendations:** Based on findings, recommendations for targeting specific user demographics (e.g., those with poor sleep quality or low activity).

### **Conclusion**

A summary of the project findings and their impact on Bellabeat's marketing strategy. This section will cover how the insights can help Bellabeat refine its product offerings and user engagement strategies.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - NumPy
  - Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
